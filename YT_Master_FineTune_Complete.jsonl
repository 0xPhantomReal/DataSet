The addiction followed Rose into the NBA..\nHe was the #1 draft pick.. And instantly signed a $22million deal..\nSo he used some of those millions to hire a personal chef..\nBut, he still couldn\u2019t shake his nasty habit..\nLike even his chef was scared for his life, saying \u201cHe just eats candy, syrup, grilled cheese sandwiches, things kids eat. He never really eats real food. He\u2019s 19, he eats like he\u2019s 8... He needs a food pyramid, someone needs to put one up in his room.\u201d\nNow listen.. We\u2019re talking about a dude who got a Skittles machine.. Put into his house..\nBut Rose, he wasn\u2019t worried..\nCuz right when he came into the NBA.. He took over..\n(clip compilation showing him dunking crazy, and just having crazy highlights during his first few years with the Bulls)\nOur boy stepped into the pros and became unstoppable..\nHe won rookie of the year.. An MVP.. And carried the Bulls to the playoffs..\nLike he was so good.. He\u2019d even eat candy during the games..\nD Rose was on top of the world..\nUntil..\n(clip of him getting injured)\nUhh yeah.. This wasn\u2019t a coincidence..\nMany thought this injury was out of nowhere..\nBut if you knew how bad he was suffering from his addiction..\nYou woulda seen this coming..\nAll those years of eating unhealthy..\nWas proven in a study by healthandscience that..\nSugar weakens your bones and increases your risk of fractures..\nSo with Rose\u2019s situation.. There\u2019s no denying it..\nHe\u2019s gotten injured.. More times than I can count..\nAnd things have gotten so bad.. Coaches are literally afraid to watch him play..\nJust cuz they know, it could happen again..\nAnd Rose admitted \u201ceverybody\u2019s got their poison.. mine is sugar..\u201d\nIt kinda reminds me of a player in today\u2019s NBA..\nWho\u2019s addiction is so out of control.. His own mom had to step in.."}]}

Zion Williamson has become one of basketball\u2019s most trending topics..\nBut, not for the right reasons..\nThroughout his high school career..

Nobody understood how a dude this big, could fly like Jordan..\nJust look at this..\n(quick clip of him dunking)\nIt wasn\u2019t even fair that he could do that..\nBut to NBA teams.. It didn\u2019t matter..\nAnd even though he ballooned up to 285 pounds..\nThe Pelicans selected him with the #1 pick..\nBut, that\u2019s when his weight became a bigger headline, than his highlights..\nThat Summer.. Everybody was wondering.. what the hell was going on..\nThis dude accomplished his dream.. But was on the bench tired, and out of shape..\nHe sat out 4 months of his rookie season.. Cuz of a mysterious knee surgery..\nThen when he finally could play.. In the middle of games.. The Pelicans had him doing extra workouts..\nAnd uhh..\nI\u2019m not a million dollar basketball player..\nBut, I\u2019m pretty sure this.. isn\u2019t part of any team\u2019s gameplan..\nAnd here in 2021..

This man didn\u2019t just sneak back into his old lifestyle..\nHe literally became the face.. of Mountain Dew..\nLook at dude man.. He\u2019s.. he\u2019s just getting so out of pocket..\nAnd that\u2019s why the Pelicans are scared for his life..\nCuz their training staff exposed Zion.. and said now, he weighs over 300 POUNDS\nGod damn!\nAt this point, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any coming back from this..\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut I don\u2019t know what\u2019s crazier..\nZion\u2019s weight..\nOr you, clicking this video right here.."}]}
