A young kid who didn\u2019t just love McCaffrey, also loved playing video games.. \n\n\nUntil at just 12 years old, was sadly diagnosed with cancer, and forced to stay in the hospital for months.. \n\n\nLogan didn\u2019t feel like a normal kid cuz he wasn\u2019t able to play games or stay connected with friends..\n\n\nNow at least he got a gaming system in the hospital to help pass the time.. \n\n\nAnd honestly it helped Logan through his situation so much, that he and his family started the \u201cLogan Project\u201d, which raised money to put gaming systems in hospitals for other sick kids.. \n\n\nOnce McCaffrey eventually heard Logan was doing a lot to help others, and was also a huge fan..\n\n\nMcCaffrey visited Logan in the hospital.. then eventually sent him a video encouraging him to stay strong.. \n\n\nBut just minutes after Logan watched the video\u2026\n\n\n*flatline visual or edit with sfx*\n\n\nHe passed away.. \n\n\nMcCaffrey was the last thing Logan ever heard, so Logan was eventually buried in one of his jerseys.. \n\n\nAnd once McCaffrey found out, he had to honor his boy..\n\n\nSo he got a pair of cleats designed with a digital gaming theme, Logan\u2019s name, and the Logan Project logo on the front.. \n\n\nThen Mccaffrey not only wore them during a game where he ran for almost 100 yards, scored a touchdown, and carried his team to the win.. \n\n\nHe signed the cleats before they went to auction, where all money raised was going to fund the Logan Project.. \n\n\nAnd the cleats eventually sold for over $33,000.. \n\n\nDamn, shoutout to Mccaffrey man..\n\n\nBut let\u2019s lighten the mood back up, cuz George Kittle\u2019s cleats weren\u2019t only on another level of expensive.. they came from the 2nd greatest basketball player of all-time..\n\n\n*Beat cut* yeah I\u2019m talking about that bald dude from Chicago, who is NOT on LeBron\u2019s level! \n\n\neven more expensive, cuz he has the only pair in the entire world.."}]}

I wouldn\u2019t.. \n\n\nForreal though, even though their marriage should\u2019ve been the biggest topic.. All people cared about was the gigantic rock on her finger.. A 10 carat emerald diamond cut ring, that even has diamonds on the entire band, which flooded out her hand.. \n\n\n$800,000 later, of course she flexes it any chance she gets.. \n\n\nBut with a ring that wild, the only thing stopping me from calling her a gold.. I mean diamond digger is that she\u2019s been with Mahomes since they were both broke and looked like this..   \n\n\nNow that\u2019s scary..\n\n\nIf only that was as crazy as the expensive things Mahomes helped design for his teammates though.. \n\n\nIt\u2019s bros before hoes so obviously these rings are on a whole other level cuz the Chiefs wanted to celebrate a championship win with the most iconic championship rings in sports history.. \n\n\nThey asked Mahomes to help design it, and got to work planning the piece making multiple models.. Then they started setting in all 35 rubies, 613 diamonds, and created a custom masterpiece.. \n\n\nThe ring even featured a replica version of the Chiefs stadium on the inside, as well as the scores of every game they won on the way to the championship.. \n\n\nThe craziest part though was that these weren\u2019t even just rings.. nah, Part of it was made to detach, which allowed players to wear it as a pendant on a chain.. \n\n\nSo the entire team was hyped when they saw these.. \n\n\nBut at least nothing about those rings caused any controversies.. \n\n\nCuz when Mahomes bought something else for $20,000, it had people calling him out on social media!\n\n\n$20,000 On Louis Vuitton That Eventually Sparked A Controversy Where He Was Spotted With LV On At An NBA Game Where He Was Drinking Multiple Beers\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Mahomes was the topic of any controversy though, it started when he was constantly buying designer, especially Louis Vuitton..\n\n\nSome of Mahomes most expensive Louis fits came when he turned into D.J. Khaled, by wearing the same shirt dude wore in a poppin music video.. \n\n\nThen he was seen in a black Louis shirt for $1,500, with a black Louis jacket over the top worth another $3,400.. \n\n\nOr even the time he pulled up rocking an all red Louis jacket which cost him $3,500, while carrying his all black Louis backpack worth $3,600..\n\n\nWith all the LV talk, I\u2019m just surprised Mahomes didn\u2019t wear an LV fit, to Super Bowl LV..\n\n\nBut one of Mahomes most expensive Louis Vuitton fits, is the one he wore that had fans calling him out on social media.. \n\n\nIt seemed innocent, a vintage tee worth $1,250, jeans for $2,300, and even shoes for $1,200..  \n\n\nIts $5,000 price tag was the least of its concerns though, cuz when he wore it courtside at the Dallas Mavericks game, cameras were obviously flashin on him..  So a picture came out with what was supposed to just show off his fit, but fans noticed there were 3 beers under his chair.. \n\n\nThose had people literally acting like dude committed a crime or something! started calling him a \u201cfucking drunk\u201d, sarcastically saying \u201cwow what a role model.\u201d  One fan even said he\u2019s surprised athletes are allowed to drink.. \n\n\nAt least some fans downplayed the controversy by saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s (only) 3 beers dude\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s like water bro.\u201d \n\n\nBesides, to me the only crime committed here were the prices on those drinks, they were damn near more expensive than dude\u2019s whole $20,000 Louis Vuitton wardrobe.. Stadium prices are ridiculous! \n\n\nBut with all those expensive clothes.. Mahomes keeps them in some of the craziest homes of any NFL player ever.. \n\n\nCondo/Mansion Collection \n\n\nBefore we get to that one though, over the years Mahomes has spent millions on condos and obviously it doesn\u2019t look too bad.. But it\u2019s a shitstain compared to the rest of his collection..\n\n\nThere was a time dude bought a mansion, just so there was enough room for over 100 shoes in his walk-in shoe closet.. \n\n\nAfter copping all that though.. Mahomes became an NFL star so he started working on his biggest project yet, and copped this..  *Beat cut/record scratch*\n\n\nOkay obviously I\u2019m kidding.. Kinda.. Mahomes really bought this empty plot of land for $400,000, with plans to turn it into the craziest house any NFL player owns.. \n\n\nSo after months of labor and millions of dollars later..

I wouldn\u2019t.. \n\n\nForreal though, even though their marriage should\u2019ve been the biggest topic.. All people cared about was the gigantic rock on her finger.. A 10 carat emerald diamond cut ring, that even has diamonds on the entire band, which flooded out her hand.. \n\n\n$800,000 later, of course she flexes it any chance she gets.. \n\n\nBut with a ring that wild, the only thing stopping me from calling her a gold.. I mean diamond digger is that she\u2019s been with Mahomes since they were both broke and looked like this..   \n\n\nNow that\u2019s scary..\n\n\nIf only that was as crazy as the expensive things Mahomes helped design for his teammates though.. \n\n\nIt\u2019s bros before hoes so obviously these rings are on a whole other level cuz the Chiefs wanted to celebrate a championship win with the most iconic championship rings in sports history.. \n\n\nThey asked Mahomes to help design it, and got to work planning the piece making multiple models.. Then they started setting in all 35 rubies, 613 diamonds, and created a custom masterpiece.. \n\n\nThe ring even featured a replica version of the Chiefs stadium on the inside, as well as the scores of every game they won on the way to the championship.. \n\n\nThe craziest part though was that these weren\u2019t even just rings.. nah, Part of it was made to detach, which allowed players to wear it as a pendant on a chain.. \n\n\nSo the entire team was hyped when they saw these.. \n\n\nBut at least nothing about those rings caused any controversies.. \n\n\nCuz when Mahomes bought something else for $20,000, it had people calling him out on social media!\n\n\n$20,000 On Louis Vuitton That Eventually Sparked A Controversy Where He Was Spotted With LV On At An NBA Game Where He Was Drinking Multiple Beers\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Mahomes was the topic of any controversy though, it started when he was constantly buying designer, especially Louis Vuitton..\n\n\nSome of Mahomes most expensive Louis fits came when he turned into D.J. Khaled, by wearing the same shirt dude wore in a poppin music video.. \n\n\nThen he was seen in a black Louis shirt for $1,500, with a black Louis jacket over the top worth another $3,400.. \n\n\nOr even the time he pulled up rocking an all red Louis jacket which cost him $3,500, while carrying his all black Louis backpack worth $3,600..\n\n\nWith all the LV talk, I\u2019m just surprised Mahomes didn\u2019t wear an LV fit, to Super Bowl LV..\n\n\nBut one of Mahomes most expensive Louis Vuitton fits, is the one he wore that had fans calling him out on social media.. \n\n\nIt seemed innocent, a vintage tee worth $1,250, jeans for $2,300, and even shoes for $1,200..  \n\n\nIts $5,000 price tag was the least of its concerns though, cuz when he wore it courtside at the Dallas Mavericks game, cameras were obviously flashin on him..  So a picture came out with what was supposed to just show off his fit, but fans noticed there were 3 beers under his chair.. \n\n\nThose had people literally acting like dude committed a crime or something! started calling him a \u201cfucking drunk\u201d, sarcastically saying \u201cwow what a role model.\u201d  One fan even said he\u2019s surprised athletes are allowed to drink.. \n\n\nAt least some fans downplayed the controversy by saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s (only) 3 beers dude\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s like water bro.\u201d \n\n\nBesides, to me the only crime committed here were the prices on those drinks, they were damn near more expensive than dude\u2019s whole $20,000 Louis Vuitton wardrobe.. Stadium prices are ridiculous! \n\n\nBut with all those expensive clothes.. Mahomes keeps them in some of the craziest homes of any NFL player ever.. \n\n\nCondo/Mansion Collection \n\n\nBefore we get to that one though, over the years Mahomes has spent millions on condos and obviously it doesn\u2019t look too bad.. But it\u2019s a shitstain compared to the rest of his collection..\n\n\nThere was a time dude bought a mansion, just so there was enough room for over 100 shoes in his walk-in shoe closet.. \n\n\nAfter copping all that though.. Mahomes became an NFL star so he started working on his biggest project yet, and copped this..  *Beat cut/record scratch*\n\n\nOkay obviously I\u2019m kidding.. Kinda.. Mahomes really bought this empty plot of land for $400,000, with plans to turn it into the craziest house any NFL player owns.. \n\n\nSo after months of labor and millions of dollars later.. Welcome to Mahomes\u2019s masterpiece.. \n\n\nAs we fly over you can see a private pond, a full sized par 3 golf hole, one of the craziest mansions I\u2019ve ever seen that looks like a castle.. And his own custom turf field that has his logos all over it.. \n\n\nFrom the outside you can also see the massive pool with a slide, and every kid's dream playhouse.. \n\n\nOn the inside there's 3 bedrooms, a 500 bottle wine cellar, a huge fish tank, his own trophy room, and a basketball court he turned into a party for his son's birthday..\n\n\nI\u2019m a grown man and I\u2019ve still never got a raw party like that.. My parents are ass.. \n\n\nBut even though Mahomes spent millions on homes.. It ain\u2019t like he\u2019s actually addicted to buying them.. \n\n\nHe\u2019s addicted to something else, which not only made him spend over $1Million to get his whole city addicted..

(What do you mean by that meme) No I\u2019m serious just look.. \n\n\nDamn, I didn\u2019t know dude\u2019s milf got down like that.. \n\n\nBut what\u2019s crazy is all of this only happened cuz of what Austin spent his first check on\u2026.. \n\n\nHis gaming setup.. \n\n\n$10,000 to play video games these days?..

Gronk really waited all those years, and made millions on millions on millions of dollars, just to buy a chain for $10,000..\n\n\nMan\u2019s crazy, but Alvin Kamara did his jewelry purchase a lil different by putting somethin in his mouth.   \n\n\nWhenever you see this dude he\u2019s smiling, and I\u2019m sure you can see why..

That\u2019s why he blew $50,000 on it..\n\n\nLamar Jackson spent double that, by turning his craziest play in college, where he literally jumped over a grown ass man during a game, and right after the moment went viral, Lamar got drafted to the NFL then spent his first check turning the moment into a gold and diamond chain, worth 100k\u2026 \n\n\nSpeaking of a game though.. Pat Surtain the 2nd.. Or better known as his nickname, PS2, ya know.. like the gaming console.. He embraced the name enough to spend his first check getting a jeweler to design him a diamond PS2 controller.. \n\n\nAnd yeah the thing actually lights up too, but another player Breece Hall spent his first check on a chain that was more expensive just so millions of people got a piece of it.. \n\n\nBreece got a necklace of his initials BH, that was covered in diamonds, claws and scratch marks made from rubies.. \n\n\nSo obviously a chain this detailed had a wild price tag, $300,000, but he didn\u2019t ONLY buy it for him.. \n\n\nCuz right after, Breece created his own brand of cereal, where his fans could buy it and if they did, on the inside of every box there was a replica version of his chain just so the world could flex like him..\n\n\nNow that\u2019s a jewelry purchase I respect, but the stupidest way another player spent his first bag on jewelry, was getting one of the biggest chains I\u2019ve ever seen.. \n\n\nWith over 120 carats of flawless diamonds, this dude literally got a huge ass ticket, just cuz people called him \u201cthe big ticket\u201d for $400,000..  \n\n\n$400,000 of his FIRST check, just to ice himself..
